<h3>This is my rendition of a netflix clone. Using React Query, React Router, and styled components I was able to create this beautiful site.</h3>
<p>Each page is styled using styled components. </p>
<p>Using fetchAPI from the TMDB website, I was able to pull data I needed. This data included the image. Using custom hooks, and react query I was able to easily map through the data to find and use what I needed and display it on screen.</p>

<p>While the site is mostly complete from a front-end perspective, features that will be added at a later date for backend tasks include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Hover component giving details of the movie/tv show being hovered over</li>
  <li>User login page</li>
  <li>Authentication using supabase, firebase, or mongoDb</li>
  <li>An account page</li>
  <li>Dynamic "My List" using the users saved tv shows/movies (also using one of the above databases)</li>
</ol>
